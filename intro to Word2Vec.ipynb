    "This notebook presents practical methods for learning from natural text. Using simple combinations of deep learning, classification, and regression, I demonstrate how to predict a blogger's gender and age with high accuracy based on his or her blog posts. More specifically, I create text features using the [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) deep learning model implemented in the [Gensim](http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) Python package, and then perform classification and regression using the machine learning toolkits in [GraphLab Create](https://dato.com/products/create/).\n",

    "After loading the blogs data into a SFrame object, the next step is to use the blog post texts and train a [Word2Vec](https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/) model. Without getting into too much details, Word2Vec learns the semantic relationship between words. For our purposes, it's okay to treat Word2Vec as a magical blackbox that takes words as input and returns a vector of numbers that represent the input word and its meaning. \n",

This section contains the code for constructing Word2Vec.  You can follow along and train your own model or just directly download the trained model ([file1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dato-models/deep_text_learning/word2vec_model/blog_posts_300_c_40.word2vec), [file2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dato-models/deep_text_learning/word2vec_model/blog_posts_300_c_40.word2vec.syn0.npy), [file3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dato-models/deep_text_learning/word2vec_model/blog_posts_300_c_40.word2vec.syn1.npy)) and skip to the next section on creating & evaluating Machine Learning classification and regression models. \n",

It is important to note that some of these blogs are written over time duration of years. Therefore, it can be hard to predict the blogger's exact age. It may be better to instead classify the blogger's age group using classification models."

    "In this notebook, we demonstrate that deep learning can generate useful features for predicting the gender and age of a blogger based on his or her blog post content. If you want to continue to explore this dataset yourself, there are a lot more that can be done. You can try to predict a blogger's astrological sign using his or her blogs. (I didn't succeed in building a prediction model that works better than random prediction. But you might!) You can try to predict a blogger's professional industry. You can also train the Word2Vec model on a different text corpus such as Wikipedia, and see if that gives you better results. We hope that the methods and code presented in this notebook can assist you to solve other text analysis tasks."
